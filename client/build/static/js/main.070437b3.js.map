This project had only one goal - understand React and get an experience in React + Redux. Once I found\n                    <a href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> The Movie DB API</a> and ideas like bricks began to build this project in my mind.\n                    It takes a lot of time as questions have been raised not only about the appearance, but in functionality as well. Firstly, inspired by the idea\n                    of the React tutorial I started to build an application that simply allows to create a list of favorites movies. For now, I would like to implement the database,\n                    which would contain users and their lists, like user's favorites, or list of Marvel movies, or an empty list of good movies with Ben Affleck.\n                    As almost all frontend work is complete, I can start to learn NodeJS to implement this idea.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <div id=\"structure\" className=\"card large\">\n                    <h3>Project Info</h3>\n                    <h5>Tools</h5>\n                    <p>\n                    As I said, my main goal was to obtain an experince in <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\">React</a>, as I knew nothing about it at the beginning.\n                    For quick start I used <a href=\"https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app\">create-react-app</a> that \n                    makes initialization really fast and simple without worrying about <a href=\"https://webpack.github.io/\">Webpack</a> stuff.\n                    There is also <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">NodeJS</a> with <a href=\"http://expressjs.com/\">Express</a> on backend. Again, simple and easy.<br/>\n                    Of course, there is also <a href=\"http://redux.js.org/\">react-redux</a> module. \n                    Currently it is used only to keep in state search results, as some search happens when user\n                    type query in search bar and some when he changes a page on search result's page. It is easy to see from Project Tree\n                    that these two components lie in different levels of nesting, so it is much easier to have a main state and take necessary properties and actions\n                    from those components that needs them.\n                    To not bother about the appearance I used <a href=\"http://materializecss.com/\">MaterializeCSS</a>.\n                    </p>\n                    <h5>Project Tree</h5>\n                    <AppTree toggleTree={this.toggleTree} isTreeExpanded={this.state.isTreeExpanded}/>\n                    <p>\n                    I devided sources to stateless components and containers. Components that are used only by one container lie in the same folder with it.\n                    Some containers, such as <i className=\"tree-component\">MovieVideos</i> are reusable.\n                    Also, I decided to put all reducer stuff in a separate folder, instead of keeping them in the same folder with the containers that are used them.\n                    </p>\n                    <h5>Noteworthy components</h5>\n                    <p><i>SearchBar and SearchPage</i> - component that returns search bar that lies in header. \n                    This component keeps its own state with query string and search suggestions that are passed to SearchSuggestions component. \n                    When a user click Enter button, he dispatches search action that fetches data from API and set it to the state. \n                    While fetching, user is redirected to the search page, where all results from redux state will be shown as soon as they will be ready.</p>\n                    <p><i>CardCollection</i> - allows user to search for a person, a character or a movie. It takes an array or collection of data and the function that maps this array\n                    to render elements. I did it in this way to make component more reusable. With this map method CardCollection maps an array of filtered elements,\n                    elements from an main array that contains inputed value.</p>\n                    <p>More info soon...</p>\n                </div>\n                <div id=\"me\" className=\"card large\">\n                    <h3>About me</h3>\n                    <h5>Main info</h5>\n                    <p>My name is Oleksandr Shvechykov and I am from Ukraine - wonderful country with a plenty of smart and talanted people.\n                    Once I understood that in variety of directions I could go in IT world, web-developing is much preferable for me. \n                    After some time with C++ I realized that in love with JS.
